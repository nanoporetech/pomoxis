Pomoxis - bioinformatics tools for nanopore research 
====================================================

Â© 2018 Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.

Pomoxis comprises a set of basic bioinformatic tools tailored to nanopore
sequencing. Notably tools are included for generating and analysing draft
assemblies. Many of these tools are used by the research data analysis
group at Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

See :doc:`programs` for common simple tasks.


Features
--------

 * Wraps third party tools with known good default parameters
   and methods of use.
 * Creates an isolated environment with all third-party tools.
 * Can be installed with conda.
 * Streamlines common short analysis chains.
 * Integrates into `katuali <https://github.com/nanoporetech/katuali>`_
   for performing more complex analysis pipelines.
 * Open source (Mozilla Public License 2.0).


.. admonition:: Research Release

    Research releases are provided as technology demonstrators to provide early
    access to features or stimulate Community development of tools. Support for
    this software will be minimal and is only provided directly by the developers.
    Feature requests, improvements, and discussions are welcome and can be
    implemented by forking and pull requests. However much as we would
    like to rectify every issue and piece of feedback users may have, the 
    developers may have limited resource for support of this software. Research
    releases may be unstable and subject to rapid iteration by Oxford Nanopore
    Technologies.


Compatibility
-------------

Pomoxis is developed on Ubuntu 16.04, other recent linuxes should be
equally compatible (see build notes below). Pomoxis is known to work on
at least some MacOS High Sierra configurations, though some components,
notably scrappy, are known to not work on some MacOS configurations
(combinations of OS and xcode versions).


Installation
------------

Much of pomoxis's functionality is dependent on thirty party tools. These
can be provided by the user, or can be installed with the help of the
provided `Makefile`


**Installation with conda**

Pomoxis is available on `bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/pomoxis/>`_
and so can be most easily installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install pomoxis


**Installation with pip**
  
Pomoxis can be installed using the python package manager, pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop
    pip install pomoxis

We recommend using medaka within a virtual environment, viz.:

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv pomoxis --python=python3 --prompt "(pomoxis) "
    . pomoxis/bin/activate
    pip install git+https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop
    pip install pomoxis

.. note::

    Using this method requires the user to provide several binaries:

    `minimap2 <https://github.com/lh3/minimap2>`_,
    `miniasm <https://github.com/lh3/miniasm>`_,
    `samtools <https://github.com/samtools/samtools>`_,
    `racon <https://github.com/isovic/racon>`_,
    `samtools <https://github.com/samtools/samtools>`_,
    `bcftools <https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/>`_, and
    `seqkit <https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkiti>`_,

    and place these within the `PATH`.


**Installation from source**

With this method pomoxis will install itself into a an isolated virtual
environment. The installation will fetch, compile, and install all direct
dependencies into the environment. Use this method if you do not wish to
use conda, but will not be providing the third-party binaries.

.. note::

    Before installing pomoxis is may be required to install some prerequisite
    packages, best installed by a package manager. On Ubuntu these are:

    gcc-4.9 g++-4.9 zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev python3-all-dev libhdf5-dev
    libatlas-base-dev libopenblas-base libopenblas-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev
    libffi-dev make python-virtualenv cmake wget bzip2


To setup the environment run:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/nanoporetech/pomoxis
    cd pomoxis
    make install
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    

The installation of porechop (https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop)
requires a newer compiler than is a available on some systems. It may therefore
be necessary to install a newer compiler and set environment variables before
the `make install` step:

.. code-block:: bash

    # For porechop to be compiled on older systems set these, e.g.:
    export CXX="g++-4.9" CC="gcc-4.9"

Note also that racon requires at least `gcc>=4.8.5` to
[compile smoothly](https://github.com/isovic/racon/issues/57).


**Installation without compiling third-party binaries**

Running the above within a pre-exisiting (virtual) environnment may well fail;
advanced may wish to simply run

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

in the standard manner after compiling the third party programs listed below
and ensuring they are present on the `PATH`. The `setup.py` script can copy
the binaries into the python interpreter path if they are placed within a
directory named `bincache` alongside `setup.py`. To make use of this facility
run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    POMO_BINARIES=1 python setup.py install

    
Third party binaries
